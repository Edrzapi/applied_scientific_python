# GitHub Actions CI/CD Example

This workflow demonstrates how to automate testing and deployment of a Python package using **GitHub Actions**.  
It mirrors the structure of the GitLab CI/CD example for consistency.

## Example GitHub Actions Workflow

```yaml
name: Python CI/CD

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  install_dependencies:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Python 3.10
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: '3.10'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m venv .venv
          source .venv/bin/activate
          pip install -r requirements.txt
      - name: Save environment
        run: echo "Dependencies installed"

  run_tests:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: install_dependencies
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Python 3.10
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: '3.10'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m venv .venv
          source .venv/bin/activate
          pip install -r requirements.txt

      - name: Run tests with pytest
        run: |
          source .venv/bin/activate
          pytest tests/

  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: install_dependencies
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Python 3.10
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: '3.10'

      - name: Install dependencies and build package
        run: |
          python -m venv .venv
          source .venv/bin/activate
          pip install -r requirements.txt
          pip install twine
          python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel

      - name: Upload to PyPI
        env:
          TWINE_USERNAME: ${{ secrets.TWINE_USERNAME }}
          TWINE_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.TWINE_PASSWORD }}
        run: |
          source .venv/bin/activate
          twine upload dist/*
```

## Best Practices for GitHub Actions

- Use **secrets** for your credentials — available under **Settings ➔ Secrets and variables**  
- Use `needs:` to control job order (similar to GitLab’s `dependencies`)  
- Deployment step runs only on `main` branch for safety  
- Consider caching virtual environments for faster builds

## Summary

This workflow runs on push and pull request events, installs dependencies, runs tests, and deploys to PyPI.  
GitHub Actions makes it easy to integrate testing and deployment directly into your GitHub project workflow.
